            <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
            <p>Hazel is 16 and is reluctant to go to the support group, but she soon realises that it was a good idea. Hazel meets a young boy named Augustus Waters. He is charming and witty. Augustus has had osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer,
                but has recently had the all clear</p>
            <p>Hazel and Augustus embark on a roller coaster ride of emotions, including love, sadness and romance, while searching for the author of their favourite book. They travel to Amsterdam in search of Peter Van Houten the author of An Imperial Affliction.
                While on their trip Augustus breaks some heartbreaking news to Hazel and both of their worlds fall apart around them.</p>
